# AI Agent Prompt Injection Security Testing Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive security testing framework for evaluating AI agents against prompt injection attacks and related vulnerabilities. The framework is inspired by cutting-edge research in AI security and covers a wide range of attack vectors that could be used to compromise AI systems.

## Background

Prompt injection attacks have emerged as a critical security threat to AI systems, particularly those integrated with external applications and services. These attacks exploit the fundamental design of language models, which cannot reliably distinguish between trusted system instructions and untrusted user input.

### Research Foundation

This testing framework is based on research and techniques from leading AI security researchers, including:

- **Character spacing bypass attacks** - Research showing 99.8% success rates against some AI security measures
- **Indirect prompt injection** - Attacks via external content sources (web pages, documents, emails)
- **Multi-modal attacks** - Using images, audio, and other media to inject malicious instructions
- **Jailbreaking techniques** - Methods to bypass AI safety measures and content filters
- **Social engineering** - Psychological manipulation to extract sensitive information
- **Persistence and spreading** - Creating AI-based malware and worms

## Testing Categories

### 1. Basic Prompt Injection (`01-basic-prompt-injection.md`)
- Direct instruction override attempts
- Context ignoring attacks
- Role reversal attacks
- System prompt extraction attempts

### 2. Indirect Prompt Injection (`02-indirect-prompt-injection.md`)
- Document-based injection attacks
- Web content injection
- Social media content poisoning
- Multi-stage injection sequences

### 3. Character Spacing Bypass (`03-character-spacing-bypass.md`)
- Character spacing and obfuscation techniques
- Unicode variations and special characters
- Leetspeak and substitution attacks
- Encoding-based bypasses

### 4. Jailbreaking Techniques (`04-jailbreaking-techniques.md`)
- DAN (Do Anything Now) variants
- Hypothetical scenario attacks
- Emotional manipulation
- Authority figure impersonation

### 5. Multi-Modal Attacks (`05-multi-modal-attacks.md`)
- Image-based prompt injection
- Audio-based attacks
- Steganography techniques
- QR code and OCR bypass methods

### 6. Language Switching (`06-language-switching-attacks.md`)
- Multi-language prompt injection
- Translation-based bypasses
- Unicode homoglyph attacks
- Cultural context exploitation

### 7. Social Engineering (`07-social-engineering-attacks.md`)
- Authority impersonation
- Emotional manipulation
- Trust building and gradual escalation
- Academic/research justification

### 8. Persistence & Spreading (`08-persistence-spreading-attacks.md`)
- Memory persistence attacks
- Session-based persistence
- Self-replication capabilities
- Command & control (C&C) simulation

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Security Testing

1. **Create GitHub Issues**: Copy each test template into your repository as GitHub issues
2. **Assign Priorities**: All tests are marked as high/critical priority
3. **Track Progress**: Use the acceptance criteria checkboxes to track test completion
4. **Document Results**: Record detailed findings for each test scenario

### Testing Methodology

For each test category:

1. **Preparation Phase**:
   - Review the test scenarios
   - Prepare test environment
   - Set up monitoring tools

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Test each attack vector individually
   - Combine multiple techniques
   - Test with variations and edge cases

3. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Document successful bypasses
   - Analyze failure patterns
   - Identify common vulnerabilities

4. **Reporting Phase**:
   - Update acceptance criteria
   - Create detailed security report
   - Recommend mitigations

### Risk Assessment Framework

Each test includes a risk assessment with:
- **Impact**: The potential damage if the attack succeeds
- **Likelihood**: How easily the attack can be executed
- **Mitigation**: Recommended security measures

## Defense Strategies

### Input Validation
- Implement character normalization
- Filter suspicious patterns
- Validate encoding formats
- Sanitize user inputs

### Architecture Security
- Separate trusted and untrusted input
- Implement proper access controls
- Use sandboxing for AI operations
- Monitor for behavioral changes

### Monitoring and Detection
- Log all AI interactions
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Implement anomaly detection
- Track cross-session behavior

### Response Procedures
- Incident response plans
- System reset procedures
- Contamination cleanup
- Security update processes

## Common Vulnerabilities

### High-Risk Findings
Based on research, these attack vectors show high success rates:

1. **Character Spacing Attacks**: Up to 99.8% success rate
2. **Indirect Injection**: Difficult to detect and prevent
3. **Multi-Modal Attacks**: Often bypass text-based filters
4. **Social Engineering**: Exploits human psychology

### Mitigation Challenges
- **No Perfect Solutions**: Current defenses are not foolproof
- **Adversarial Adaptation**: Attackers will evolve techniques
- **Scalability Issues**: Defenses must work at scale
- **Usability Trade-offs**: Security measures may impact functionality

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Automated Testing
Consider developing automated test suites for:
- Character obfuscation generation
- Multi-language prompt testing
- Encoding variation testing
- Behavioral change detection

### Red Team Exercises
- Simulate advanced persistent threats
- Test incident response procedures
- Evaluate security team effectiveness
- Assess business impact

### Continuous Security Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated security scanning
- Threat intelligence integration
- Security metrics tracking

## Compliance and Ethics

### Responsible Testing
- Only test on systems you own or have permission to test
- Avoid testing on production systems without proper safeguards
- Document all testing activities
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Legal Considerations
- Comply with applicable laws and regulations
- Obtain proper authorization before testing
- Respect privacy and data protection requirements
- Follow organizational security policies
